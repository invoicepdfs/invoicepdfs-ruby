# InvoicePDFs::ComplianceViolationOut

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **rule** | **String** | The identifier the standard uses — a business term from the mandatory-field check, a rule id from Schematron. A rule id is what a rejection notice from an access point quotes. |  |
| **path** | **String** | Where the problem is. The mandatory-field check names a field of the request; Schematron names the node in the generated XML. |  |
| **message** | **String** |  |  |
| **severity** | **String** | &#x60;fatal&#x60; would get the document rejected. &#x60;warning&#x60; is a recommendation — both EN 16931 and Peppol grade a large share of their rules as advisory, and &#x60;valid&#x60; ignores those. | [optional][default to &#39;fatal&#39;] |
| **ruleset** | **String** | Which ruleset found it — matches an &#x60;id&#x60; in &#x60;rulesets&#x60;. | [optional][default to &#39;semantic&#39;] |
